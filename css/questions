How do you indicate the current page WITHIN the links in the navigation?  (Make sure you are not using just color)
    To indicate the current page, I used a dotted black border to indicate that that is the page the user is currently on. In addition, I change the color to dark magenta to show the difference in color.
Is “Skip to Content” available on every page - It should be hidden on the page load and appear on the first tab.  
    The skip to content is available on every page and is hidden on the page when loaded in at first. However, it appears on the first tab on every page.
Which elements use grid and which pages are these elements on?  How did you use grid differently from the homework? Why did you use the number of columns/rows?  Did you use Inspect Element to check that removing display: grid changes the page?  (Include screenshot if desired.)
    I used grid for all the pictures in the Main Page and Vacation page. I used grid differently than the homework as I used it for all my pictures to format. I chose to use 2 columns for the mobile view, because it's a longer view and not as wide as the other views. For the tablet view, I chose 3 columns, because the view is a bit wider than mobile but not as wide as the desktop view. For the desktop view, I used 4 columns for the desktop view as it is the biggest view.

Which elements use flex and which pages are these elements on?  How did you use flex differently from the homework? Which different supporting properties did you use, e.g flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify, align?  Did you use Inspect Element to check that removing display: flex changes the element?  (Include screenshot if desired.)
    I used flex for the header on all the pages, but I also used flex for structuring all of the music images on the music page. I used flex similar to the homework for the header, but I used it differently to center the images for the music page. I used justify-content and align-items to center the images and the arrow on the music page.
